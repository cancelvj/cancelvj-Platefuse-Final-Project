            <h2>The germ of an idea</h2>
               <p>The Zheng and Cancelas labs developed a mouse model that lacks a specific Rho protein. Once deleted, that mouse platelets entered a hibernation-like state. Then they developed a small molecule that also can trigger a similar effect, but reversibly.</p>

         <section class="method">
            <h2>Why is our method important?</h2>
               <p>We invented a new method of treating platelets that allows refrigeration for up to 14 days, potentially tripling shelf life. Such an improvement could transform blood banking and will prevent unnecessary waste of resources.</p>
         </section>

         <section class="goals">
            <h2>Our goal</h2>
               <p>Now that our method is patented our goal is to help move the product development process along, find strategic partners for investment, and ultimately provide clinical impact.</p>

               <p>Ultimately, obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval also will require human-cell toxicology testing in a GMP-certified lab, plus planning and performing phase I and II clinical trials.</p>

               <p>Our final objective is to prevent unnecessary waste of vital resources increasing platelets shelf life. Our method will transform blood banking as it will help with unpredictable situations of platelet shortages with a more stable inventory that could then be available for all patients in need.</p>
